        <h2>This Is From My Heart</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve made mistakes, I’ve hurt you, and I carry that with me.
            But I also carry the love I feel for you every single day.
            This space is my attempt to show you what words have failed to say.

        <h2>My Mistakes</h2>
        <p>
            I didn’t always listen.
            I wasn’t always patient.
            I took things for granted.
            And I hurt you — the one person who means the most to me.
            I’m deeply sorry.

            I still dream of traveling with you, dancing in our kitchen, and building a life side by side.

            I won’t give up on us.
